Description: Computing of the kernel measure of multi-sample dissimilarity (KMD) between several samples
    using K-nearest neighbor graphs and minimum spanning trees. Implementation of the tests based
    on KMD for H0: the M distributions are equal against H1: not all the distributions are equal. Both
    permutation test and asymptotic test are available. The tests are consistent against all alternatives
    where at least two samples have different distributions. The KMD measures the dissimilarity
    between multiple samples, based on the observations from them. It converges to the population
    quantity (depending on the kernel) which is between 0 and 1. A small value indicates the multiple
    samples are from the same distribution, and a large value indicates the corresponding distributions
    are different. The population quantity is 0 if and only if all distributions are the same, and 1
    if and only if all distributions are mutually singular.
